      <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
      <p class="small">
        These core ideas explain how football actually works. Before learning formations or positions,
        you should understand downs, yardage, drives, scoring, and basic offensive and defensive strategy.
      </p>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Downs &amp; Yardage (The Heart of Football)</h2>
        <p>
          Every possession revolves around a simple goal:
          <strong>gain 10 yards in 4 downs</strong>. If the offense reaches 10 yards, they earn
          a <strong>first down</strong> and get a new set of four downs.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1st Down:</strong> Start of a series; play calls are flexible.</li>
          <li><strong>2nd Down:</strong> Adjust based on how many yards are left.</li>
          <li><strong>3rd Down:</strong> Higher pressure; teams often pass more.</li>
          <li><strong>4th Down:</strong> Usually a punt or field goal, unless the team “goes for it.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Coaches talk about <strong>down-and-distance</strong> to describe the situation,
          like “3rd and 4” or “2nd and 10.”

        <h2>Field Structure</h2>
        <p>
          A football field is <strong>100 yards</strong> long with a <strong>10-yard end zone</strong>
          at each end. Numbers on the field show each 10-yard increment.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>End Zones:</strong> Where touchdowns are scored.</li>
          <li><strong>Hash Marks:</strong> The exact left/right spot where each play begins.</li>
          <li><strong>Sidelines:</strong> Stepping out of bounds stops the game clock and the play.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>The scoring system rewards both big plays and smart decisions.</p>
        <table class="concept-table">
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Play Type</th><th>Points</th><th>Description</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Touchdown</td><td>6</td><td>Ball carried or caught in the end zone.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Extra Point</td><td>1</td><td>Kick through the uprights after a touchdown.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Two-Point Conversion</td><td>2</td><td>Run or pass attempt from the 2-yard line.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Field Goal</td><td>3</td><td>Kick through the uprights during a drive.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Safety</td><td>2</td><td>Defense tackles the offense in their own end zone.</td></tr>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Basic Offensive Structure</h2>
        <p>
          Offenses blend <strong>run plays</strong>, <strong>pass plays</strong>, and
          <strong>option plays</strong>. The quarterback (QB) reads the defense to decide
          where the ball should go.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Run Play:</strong> QB hands the ball to a running back (RB).</li>
          <li><strong>Pass Play:</strong> QB throws to a wide receiver (WR) or tight end (TE).</li>
          <li><strong>Run-Pass Option (RPO):</strong> QB chooses to hand off or throw after the snap.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Basic Defensive Structure</h2>
        <p>
          Defenses try to stop the offense by balancing coverage and pressure.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Man Coverage:</strong> Each defender guards a specific receiver.</li>
          <li><strong>Zone Coverage:</strong> Defenders cover areas of the field.</li>
          <li><strong>Blitz:</strong> Extra players rush the quarterback to force quick decisions.</li>
