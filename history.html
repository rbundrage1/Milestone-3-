<h1>History of American Football</h1>

<p>
  American football grew out of English rugby and soccer in the late 1800s,
  but over time it developed its own rules, strategies, and culture.
  Below is a quick tour of how the game started, how it changed,
  the setbacks it faced, and why it looks the way it does today.
</p>

<h2>Early Origins (Late 1800s)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>College roots:</strong> Early games were played between colleges like Rutgers, Princeton, Harvard, and Yale.</li>
  <li><strong>Rugby-style rules:</strong> Players could kick, carry, and scrum for the ball. There was no clear line of scrimmage yet.</li>
  <li><strong>Walter Camp:</strong> Often called the “father of American football,” he helped create ideas like the line of scrimmage, the snap, and the system of downs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Evolution of the Rules</h2>
<p>The rules kept changing to separate football from rugby and to make the game safer and more exciting.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Downs and yardage:</strong> Teams had to move the ball a certain number of yards in a set number of downs, which brought more strategy.</li>
  <li><strong>The forward pass (early 1900s):</strong> At first the game was almost all running. Legalizing the forward pass opened the field and led to modern passing attacks.</li>
  <li><strong>Standard positions and formations:</strong> Offense and defense became more specialized (QB, RB, WR, LB, CB, etc.), and coaches created formations like the T, I-formation, and later spread sets.</li>
  <li><strong>Equipment and fields:</strong> Leather helmets turned into hard plastic helmets with face masks, fields added hash marks and goal posts were moved back, and stadiums got larger and more organized.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Major Setbacks and Controversies</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Early injuries and deaths:</strong> In the early 1900s the game was so violent that many players were seriously hurt or killed. There were calls to ban football completely.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety reforms:</strong> To save the sport, leaders created new rules against dangerous formations, allowed the forward pass, and later added targeting rules, better tackling techniques, and concussion protocols.</li>
  <li><strong>Head injuries and CTE:</strong> In recent years, concern about long-term brain injuries has led to more research, new tackling rules, and changes to practice and kickoff rules.</li>
  <li><strong>College and pro debates:</strong> Issues like player pay, amateur status, labor disputes, and league rules have all challenged the sport and forced it to keep changing.</li>
</ul>

<!-- END TIMELINE -->

<h2>Why the Game Looks the Way It Does Today</h2>
<p>Modern football is the result of all these changes and debates.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>More passing, more speed:</strong> Because of rule changes that protect quarterbacks and receivers, many offenses now focus on spread formations, quick passes, and big plays.</li>
  <li><strong>Specialized roles:</strong> Players train for very specific jobs (for example, slot receiver vs. outside receiver, edge rusher vs. inside linebacker), which makes the game faster and more complex.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety first (but still physical):</strong> New rules try to reduce dangerous hits and protect players’ heads while still keeping the sport tough and competitive.</li>
  <li><strong>Technology and replay:</strong> Video replay, advanced stats, and better equipment help coaches, refs, and players make smarter decisions.</li>
  <li><strong>Entertainment and tradition:</strong> The Super Bowl, college bowl games, rivalries, and traditions like marching bands and tailgating all help keep the game a big part of American culture.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  When you watch a game today, you are seeing more than just 22 players on a field.
  You are seeing over a century of rule changes, safety improvements, strategy evolution,
  and cultural impact all happening at once on every snap.
