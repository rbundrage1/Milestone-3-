<h2>How to Read the Diagrams</h2>
<p>
  The simple diagrams below show where players line up <strong>before the snap</strong>.
  They are drawn from the offense's point of view, moving left to right across the field.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Key:</strong> QB = Quarterback, RB = Running Back, FB = Fullback, WR = Wide Receiver,
  TE = Tight End, OL = Offensive Line, DL = Defensive Line, LB = Linebacker, CB = Cornerback, S = Safety.
</p>

<h2>Offensive Formations (Text Diagrams)</h2>

<h3>I-Formation (Traditional, Run-Heavy)</h3>
<p>
  The offense lines up under center with two backs directly behind the quarterback.
  This keeps defenders guessing which back will get the ball and is great for downhill running.
</p>
<pre>
 WR        LT LG  C  RG RT        TE        WR
                    QB
                    FB RB
</pre>

<h3>Shotgun Spread (Pass-First Look)</h3>
<p>
  In shotgun the quarterback stands a few yards behind the center, which gives more time to read the defense.
  A spread look uses multiple wide receivers to stretch the defense horizontally.
</p>
<pre>
   WR        WR        WR        WR

        LT LG  C  RG RT     TE

                 QB    RB
</pre>

<h3>Trips Right (Three Receivers to One Side)</h3>
<p>
  Trips puts three receivers on the same side of the field. This can overload a zone coverage and
  create natural picks and rub routes in man coverage.
</p>
<pre>
   WR  WR  WR                    WR

        LT LG  C  RG RT      TE

                 QB    RB
</pre>

<h2>Defensive Fronts (Text Diagrams)</h2>

<h3>4–3 Defense</h3>
<p>
  The 4–3 uses four down linemen and three linebackers. It is balanced against both the run and the pass.
</p>
<pre>
          CB           S          S           CB


        DE    DT    DT    DE
             OLB   MLB   OLB
</pre>

<h3>Nickel Defense (5 Defensive Backs)</h3>
<p>
  A nickel package removes one linebacker and adds an extra defensive back to better match up with
  three- or four-wide-receiver sets.
</p>
<pre>
      CB       S       S       CB       NB


        DE    DT    DT    DE
              MLB      OLB
</pre>

<h3>Dime Defense (6 Defensive Backs)</h3>
<p>
  Dime is an even lighter personnel package, usually used on obvious passing downs.
  The defense sacrifices size in the box to get more speed and coverage on the field.
</p>
<pre>
  CB    S    NB       S      NB    CB
